        As a child, I was always in love with drawing and color. My only memory of kindergarten is the smell of new crayons and giant easels with pots of paint to play with. As a young girl, I spent hours designing gowns on paper. In 6th grade, I had the opportunity to paint a life size mural with five other students at a special needs school, which still stands today. In high school I secretly dawdled my time away drawing portraits of other students which my classmates would buy for 25¢ each! As a young mother I became mesmerized by watercolor and was determined to learn how to paint in that medium. I kept dreaming of this while raising 5 daughters. In 2004 I had a beautiful experience which prompted me to go forward with this dream, and I was promised I would be blessed as I shared my talents. This was overwhelming, as I had no idea how to go about it! After asking for divine guidance, I sat down not even knowing what to paint and a miracle happened- it began to “magically’ flow in the form of flowers, a passion of mine. I began to share these pictures with many friends.

      Soon after, my 51 year old husband was suddenly diagnosed with terminal cancer. As I cared for him the next 2 years I was emotionally unable to paint, which continued 3 more years as I grieved and cared for my 10 year old son. About that time a very dear friend challenged me to paint the temples, to which I promptly replied I wasn’t capable or qualified to do! However, I again petitioned the heavens to teach me and “guide” my brush. In December 2007, I very timidly began. The result has been the great blessing of beginning to heal from grief and loss through art. I remembered the promise that “I would be blessed”!</p> <b></b>

      Today, my only “training” continues in the form of asking for guidance each time I paint. Each painting truly comes from my heart. The same friend that challenged me to paint the temples challenges me to paint them as fast as the prophet builds them! I secretly wish I could visit every one! My goal is to paint every temple with the hope that they will be a blessing to all I am able to share them with.
